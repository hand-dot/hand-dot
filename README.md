## About meðŸ‘‹

I am a full-time front-end engineer and I am currently working remotely. I also have a business in Japan, a web service I created. (https://labelmake.jp/)

Please feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hand-dot/). I am always happy to talk, answer questions, or discuss new opportunities.

### Love
- Service development from scratch
- Personal Development (web tools, web services etc.)
- OSS (I maintain [labelmake](https://github.com/hand-dot/labelmake), a PDF generation library.)

I often use the [Hopding/pdf-lib](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) and [daybrush/moveable](https://github.com/daybrush/moveable) libraries and I would have never set up my own business without their contribution. I am therefore very grateful to their authors, whom I support financially.

### Field of expertise
- APIs, Jamstack, React, TypeScript, JavaScript optimization, Node.js, SEO.

### Learning
- English, Marketing, Golang, etc.
